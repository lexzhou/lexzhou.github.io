I am an young academic who divides the time between Elche and Valencia, Spain. My life is mostly experienced from these two distinct locations: Elche, known for its UNESCO-recognised palm groves 🌴, and Valencia, characterised by its cosmopolitan atmosphere in tandem with serene beaches 🏄 and nearby hiking trails in the mountains ⛰️.

I speak mainly four languages 📑, generally fluent in English, Spanish and Chinese, and know the basics of Valencian (a twin language of Catalan). Outside the realm of science, I spend my time playing piano 🎶, swimming 🏊, hiking with friends 🧗, traveling with loved ones 🌍, or reading about miscellaneous science/philosophical content 📚.
