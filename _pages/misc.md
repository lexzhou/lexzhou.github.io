I am a young academic who divides the time between Elche and Valencia, Spain. My life is mostly experienced from these two distinct locations: Elche, known for its UNESCO-recognised palm groves 🌴, and Valencia, characterised by its cosmopolitan atmosphere in tandem with yummy paellas 🥘, serene beaches 🏄 and nearby hiking trails in the mountains ⛰️.

I speak mainly four languages 📑, generally fluent in English, Spanish and Chinese, and know the basics of Valencian (a close relative to Catalan). Outside the realm of science, I spend my time enjoying piano 🎶, snowboarding 🏂, tennis 🎾, hiking, 🧗, swimming 🏊, biking on the road 🚴, traveling with loved ones 🌍, or reading about miscellaneous science/philosophical content 📚.
