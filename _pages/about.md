Hi! I am a 1st-year CS PhD candidate at Princeton University, advised Prof. [Peter Henderson](https://www.peterhenderson.co/) at the [POLARIS Lab](https://www.polarislab.org/). Before joining Princeton, I was a StarBridge Scholar at Microsoft Research for a year, working with Dr. [Xing Xie][xxie].  I did my master's in CS at the University of Cambridge, funded by [Open Philanthropy][op] and supervised by Prof. [Andreas Vlachos][avlachos], and my BSc in Data Science at the Universitat Politècnica de València, where I got into research by working with Prof. [Jose Hernandez-Orallo][jhorallo].

I am interested in research about AI Evaluation, social computing, human-AI interactions and AI safety, regularly taking inspiration from psychometrics and cognitive science. At present, I mostly spend my day thinking about (i) designing robust evaluation methods that offer explanatory and predictive power of AI's capabilities and limitations, and (ii) assessing and anticipating societal impacts associated with AI in the quest of minimising AI harms while amplifying their benefits. I am especially intrigued by general-purpose systems like LLMs.

I've spent time in research/consultancy roles on AI Evaluation at Microsoft Research, Meta AI, OpenAI, Krueger AI Safety Lab, VRAIN, and European Commission JRC. My work has been featured in [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03137-3), [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/0876687a-f8b7-4b39-b513-5fee942831e8), [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/predicting-and-explaining-ai-model-performance-a-new-approach-to-evaluation/), [MIT Tech Review](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/T2aqVlWePuRfEEuIP5_yqg), [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/delltechnologies/2024/10/29/steer-your-ai-strategy-straight-amid-the-jagged-frontier/), [IEEE Spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org/chatgpt-reliability), [El País](https://english.elpais.com/technology/2024-09-25/new-ai-models-like-chatgpt-pursue-superintelligence-but-cant-be-trusted-even-when-it-comes-to-basic-questions.html), [New Scientists](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2449427-ais-get-worse-at-answering-simple-questions-as-they-get-bigger/), [QbitAI](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/VCvkSUdKT7ZgBaeLWKVoTg), [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/blog/llms-and-reliability/), among others.
