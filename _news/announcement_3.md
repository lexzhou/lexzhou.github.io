ðŸ“œ New preprint on introducing conceptual and technological innovations for a science of AI Evaluation: [General Scales Unlock AI Evaluation with Explanatory and Predictive Power](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06378)! [Takeaways on X](https://x.com/lexin_zhou/status/1899271596264825308). An [open platform](https://kinds-of-intelligence-cfi.github.io/ADELE/) calling for collaborations and extensions of our methodology. A accessible [Microsoft Research Blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/predicting-and-explaining-ai-model-performance-a-new-approach-to-evaluation/) summarizing our work for the general audience. This represents the work that I personally feel the most excited about, to date.
